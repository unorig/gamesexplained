# Chiller — features

Read this before annotating code. What the game is documented to do, with
verification status against the binary. Statuses: **open** (documented,
not found yet), **traced** (in the code, could not be exercised; say what
was tried), **confirmed** (in the code, consistent with the emulator),
**live** (observed directly), **differs** (the code does something else).
"Absent" is not a status.

  `Chiller_(1985)` and `Chiller_(game)`. The wiki's search was not reachable.
  English Wikipedia's "Chiller (video game)" is Exidy's 1986 arcade game, a

What the sources say about who made it: code by Richard Darling and graphics
by David Darling (Games That Weren't); "Creator: David Darling, Richard
Darling", title screen by Jim Wilson and music by David Dunn (Lemon64). The
game's own title screen says "PROGRAMMED BY DAVID AND RICHARD DARLING".

## Features

**Where** names the routine or table and, for *live* rows, the test
(`facts.md`, Live tests; scripts in `work/`).

| Feature | Status | Where |
|---|---|---|
| The boy walks left and right | **live** | `player_input` `$C71B`, `try_move` `$2A04`; stick right X 128 → 151 |
| The boy jumps (stick up, or SHIFT) | **live** | `fire_pressed` `$C19D`, `start_jump` `$5418`, `jump_speeds` `$544A`; stick up Y 224 → 205 → 220. SHIFT: the emulator's key-injection tools have no name for it, so `work/verify_shift.py` held the KERNAL's own shift flag `$028D` at 1 directly, re-poking it every frame since `SCNKEY` overwrites it 60 times a second; Y 224 → 205, in-air flag 1 within 30 frames |
| The boy can also run; walking, running and jumping each cost more energy than the last | **differs** | There is one walking speed and no run. Walking costs a step per about 765 passes (`walk_drain` `$5A20`), jumping a step each time `$5A09` runs out (`drain_step` `$59E6`); standing costs nothing |
| An energy bar drains, and enemies touching the boy drain it | **live** | `sprite_touch` `$CE87` → `poison_add` `$5B44`; standing still, 69 hits on each when an enemy reached him (`verify7.py`) |
| No energy means the game is over | **live** | `out_of_energy` `$5A70`, `screen_done` `$5D98`; GAME OVER (`reference/game-over.png`) |
| Eating mushrooms restores energy | **live** | tile `$54`, `tile_touch_b` `$5AC7`, `energy_add_slow` `$5B18`: 23 steps; bar 119 → 142 against a control of 119 → 119 |
| Some mushrooms are poisonous toadstools | **live** | tile `$55`: 24 steps of poison, each with a border flash (`poison_tick` `$5B2C`, `flash_border` `$72BA`) |
| All the magic crosses must be collected to leave a screen | **live** | `crosses_left` `$7F00` from the record's `+$72`: five going out, ten coming back; five poked crosses ended the forest |
| HUD: score, magic crosses collected, high score, energy bar | **live** | `hud_template` `$8400`, copied by `start_game`; score `$0406`, crosses `$041C`, bar `$042E` |
| Enemies: ghouls, zombies, ghosts and bats | **traced** | Five slots on sprites 2-6, moved by `path_step` `$CC12` along a per-slot path script decoded from `path_scripts` `$4A00`-`$4A8F` (direction bytes 0-3 ended by `$FF`), and a thrown sixth on sprite 7 (`extra_enemy` `$CCF5`); which shape is which of the manual's names is not in the code |
| Five screens: forest, cinema, ghetto, graveyard, haunted house | **live** | `level_records` `$7290`; all reached by play (`reference/screen-00-forest.png` to `screen-04-house.png`) |
| A card names each screen and says what to do | **live** | `show_level_card` `$5BC7`, cards `$4100`-`$44E8` |
| After the haunted house, the same five screens in reverse, with the girl | **live** | records `$7300`-`$7500`; `reference/screen-05-house-back.png` to `screen-09-forest-back.png` |
| On the return journey only, fire (or `?`) switches control between the boy and the girl | **live** | `switch_request` `$58B3`, `switch_allowed` `$7280` (level byte 10 on); `/` in the forest did nothing, fire and `/` on the way back gave the girl |
| On the return journey, the border colour shows who is being controlled | **live** | `tick_border` `$75B0`: 6 the boy, 10 the girl; border 6 → 10 on the switch. It also shows on the way out, where it is always the boy's |
| On the return journey, the boy collects the blue crosses and the girl the red ones | **live** | `cross_touch` `$7F50` reads colour bit 2; red crosses beside the boy were left |
| The goal is to get back to the car | **differs** | The last screen is the forest; after it `crosses_left` passes `$FE` and the game ends in a win. No car is drawn or named in the code |
| Joystick in control port 2 | **live** | `$DC00` only (`read_stick` `$C9C4`) |
| Keyboard: Z left, C right, SHIFT jump, `?` switch players | **live** | `read_controls` `$C84D` against `$4512`-`$4515`: Z and C walk, `/` (`$C5 = $37`) switches; tested through `vice_keyboard_key_press` |
| A title screen with the credits and the controls, shown after a game ends | **live** | `game_over_wait` `$7720`, title card `$7C00` |
| Music | **traced** | `music_irq` `$60F5`, the play tune `$61F8`, the card tune and jingle `$6A18`-`$6BCC`. Pitches computed for NTSC. Not heard: the tools give no audio |
| The first release played a version of *Thriller*, withdrawn and replaced with new music | **open** | Which release this is was not settled: no build text or cassette inlay to check for "Burner Loading System", and the tune's riff (C2 D2 F2 G2 D2, repeating) was not compared against a recording of V1 by an ear that knows both |

## Beyond the documentation

Found in the code, not in the manual (`facts.md`, Mechanics, Unused code
and data, Bugs):

- **The way back is the same screens as you left them.** Each outward
  screen is copied into a store as you leave it (`screen_store` `$7FE8`),
  four of them into the RAM under the KERNAL, and the way back reads them
  from there. A mushroom eaten going out is gone coming back.
- **No fall ever hurts.** `land` `$53EF` compares the fall with a limit
  and then does nothing: NOPs.
- **The ledges crumble.** Tiles `$4D`-`$53` step to the next stage every
  8th step on them and the last becomes a space.
- **The boy's own position is capped at row 22 of 24.** `move_sprite`'s
  own Y clamp holds him there even in free fall over open space with
  nothing to land on. Three crosses sit in the two rows below that and
  can never be reached; see "Can every cross be reached?", below.
- **The enemies speed up.** When every slot's lives are spent, the LEVEL
  counter goes up and `speed_up` `$5681` halves their delays.
- **The border is the player indicator on every screen**, not only on the
  way back, and flickers while poison drains the bar.
- **A shooting game underneath.** Shot-hit and kill code with a points
  table, lives, a scroller and a second-character mode, none reached.
- **A silenced sound player** whose SID stores all go to `$FFFF`.
- **SILVER CROSSES**, in HUD rows that are never shown.
- **Bugs**: PRESS CTRL FOR MENU never appears (the routine only loads);
  the jump sound's pitch falls when it should rise; the title flicker
  writes a level record instead of `$D023`.

## Open questions

- **Which release is this?** Games That Weren't describes a withdrawn
  first version (V1) with *Thriller* music by David Dunn and later
  copies with new music, also by Dunn. Their one documented way to tell
  the cassette releases apart by eye is cover text: V1's inlay has no
  "Burner Loading System" mention in the top-right red triangle: a
  physical detail that a PRG dump, with no cassette inlay attached,
  cannot carry either way. This image's loader writes `(ANTISOFT)` into
  the BASIC stub (`orientation.md`), so someone other than Mastertronic
  has handled it, which is no help either. The played tune's voice 1
  opens on a five-note riff, C2 D2 F2 G2 D2, repeating with an occasional
  octave leap to F3 or D3 (`facts.md`, "Music"; `work/sweep-tune-ntsc.txt`).
  Still open: nobody who worked this run could compare that riff against
  a recording of V1's *Thriller* by ear with confidence, so it was not
  settled either way. Whoever can hum both is closer to answering this
  than any more bytes are.
- **Can every cross be reached?** Settled for Gold: no, not quite. A
  Lemon64 user comment (2022) remembered the game as impossible to
  finish because one cross was out of reach, later fixed by a crack.
  `work/reach.py` models `try_move`'s own rules and searches every
  screen from its start position pixel by pixel; nine of the ten screens
  have every cross reachable, and three blue crosses on the way back do
  not, all in the play area's bottom two rows. `work/verify_reach4.py`
  confirms it live: `move_sprite`'s Y clamp holds the boy's own position
  at row 22 even falling through open space with nothing to land on, so
  those three crosses sit below any row his sprite can ever occupy
  (`facts.md`, "Three crosses cannot be reached"). Not the Lemon64
  comment's one cross, but a real dead end all the same, since the way
  back needs every cross, blue and red, to finish.
- **Which of the manual's enemies is which.** Sprites 2-6 are the five
  enemy slots and 7 the thrown one (`facts.md`); the manual's ghouls,
  zombies, ghosts and bats are not named in the code, so matching them
  to shapes is by eye only.
- **The picture nobody placed.** Games That Weren't shows a screenshot
  from *Your Commodore* that matches no screen in the released game.
  Noted in case a stray bitmap turns up in the sweep.
