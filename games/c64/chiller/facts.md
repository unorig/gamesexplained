# Chiller — verified technical facts

Current truth for this game. The workflow lives in `kit/skills/`; how this
understanding developed lives in `agent-history.md`. Every fact names
the routine or table it comes from. Unless marked *live*, a fact comes
from reading the code in the snapshot named in `orientation.md`.

## Build

No build identifier was found in the image: the string sweep
(`work/sweep_strings.py`) turned up no version or date text. The loader's
`(ANTISOFT)` mark is a third party's (`orientation.md`). Which of the two
releases this is (the *Thriller* music or the later one) is open:
`features.md`.

## Memory layout

Where the CPU runs during play: non-stopping exec checkpoints over ranges,
3 s from `work/play-idle.vsf` with no input (`work/orient_cpu.py`, *live*):

| Range | Instructions in 3 s |
|---|---|
| `$0800`-`$2FFF` | 69,707 |
| `$3000`-`$4FFF` | 0 |
| `$5000`-`$5FFF` | 158,250 |
| `$6000`-`$6FFF` | 1,804 |
| `$7000`-`$7FFF` | 36,859 |
| `$8000`-`$BFFF` | 0 |
| `$C000`-`$CFFF` | 379,203 |
| `$E000`-`$FFFF` | 10,521 (the KERNAL's IRQ path, `$EA31` and on) |

This corrects `orientation.md`, which placed the engine's live code at
`$A000`-`$BFFF`: nothing ran there in 3 s of play.

| Thing | Where |
|---|---|
| Screen | `$0400` (`$D018 = $1D`, VIC bank 0) |
| Character set | `$3000`-`$37FF` (`$D018`) |
| Level records, one per screen, `$80` bytes each (`$100` between 4 and 5) | `$7000`-`$757F`; card pointer at `+$74` |
| Level cards | `$4100`-`$44E8` |
| Music player and tune | `$60A0`-`$61F7`, tune `$61F8`-`$6A15` |
| IRQ vector `$0314` | `music_irq` `$60F5`, set by `music_start` `$60CA` |

## Twin copies

`work/sweep_twins.py` compares every non-blank 256-byte page with every
other; `work/sweep_shadow.py` does the same for 32-byte windows above
`$E000`.

| Block | Twin | Bytes that differ | Which the code reads |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$3000`-`$33FF`, the first 128 glyphs | `$8000`-`$83FF` | 1 | Both: `$8000` is the forest's set, which `setup_screen` copies to `$3000` (records 0 and 9) |
| `$0500`-`$06FF`, screen rows 7-19 | `$8500`-`$86FF` | 2 | `$0400`. `$8450` is the forest's play area as loaded, copied in by record 0; `$8400` is the HUD template (`hud_template`) |
| `$0900`-`$09FF` | `$CE00`-`$CEFF` | 0 | The loader's copier put it there (`orientation.md`) |
| `$C001`-`$CDE0`, in pieces | `$F140`-`$FEDF`, at distances `$30FF`-`$313F` | not measured | `$C000`-`$CFFF`. The only bank switch, `copy_under_kernal` `$72A4` (`$01 = $34`), is given only the way-back records' descriptors, which read `$E028`-`$EFEF`, so nothing reads the copy (`work/under_io.py`); excluded in `game.json` |
| `$B600`-`$BEFF` | itself, shifted by `$100`-`$800` | 1-11 | Repeating fill (`$FF` with `$00` every few bytes), not data |

## Timing

The music is driven from the system IRQ: `music_irq` counts zp `$02` down
each interrupt and plays the next command when it reaches the tempo in
`$02AA`. The tune sets the tempo to 6 (`$61FE`). The IRQ is the KERNAL's
CIA timer, not a raster interrupt: `music_irq` ran 1,799 times in 30 s
(*live*, `work/verify7.py`), 60 a second on this PAL machine, and it exits
through `$EA31`, which runs SCNKEY (`$EA87`, 61 hits in 1 s, `work/verify5.py`).

Play itself is not timed. `main_loop` `$CA00` runs flat out, and the game
paces things by counting passes: `player_input` every 32nd pass
(`$CF03`), `joy_move` every 8th, the crosses' flash every 40th call
(`colour_cycle`), a jump step every `jump_speeds[n]` passes. The only
raster waits are `wait_line16` `$5BB0` (before swapping sprites and on the
poison flicker) and `scroll_wait` `$C46B` (in the scroller nothing uses).
So the game's speed depends on how much each pass does, and slows when
many enemies are on screen.

## Controls

The stick in control port 2 (`$DC00`) is the only CIA1 port read, and
the game never writes to CIA1. The keys come from the KERNAL's own scan,
still running in the IRQ: `read_controls` `$C84D` compares the key code
in `$C5` with the level's key table `$4512`-`$4515` and reads SHIFT from
the KERNAL's shift flag `$028D`.

| Control | Code | Result |
|---|---|---|
| Stick left, right | `read_stick` `$C9C4`, bits 2 and 3 → `$C1ED` | walks, *live* |
| Stick up, SHIFT | stick bit 0 or `$028D` → `$C1EE` → `fire_pressed` `$C19D` → `start_jump` `$5418` | jumps, *live* for the stick (Y 224 → 205 → 220) |
| Z, C | `$C5 = $0C`, `$14` against `$4514`, `$4515` | walk left and right, *live* (X 128 → 105, 128 → 148) |
| Fire, `?` | the stick's fire bit, or `$C5 = $37` (the `/` key; `?` is its shifted face) → `switch_request` `$58B3` → `switch_allowed` `$7280` | swaps the boy and the girl, only from level byte 10 on, *live* |
| SPACE | `$C5 = $3C`, in the table twice as up | nothing: up is not a direction on any screen (`$4500 = 0`) |
| RUN/STOP | the KERNAL | `end_game` `$2CB4` |

Up on the stick jumps; nothing climbs. On all ten screens up and down are
switched off as directions (`$4500`-`$4503` = 0, 0, 1, 1, read from the
snapshots taken on arrival, `work/settings10.py`), so the only way up is
the jump; no ladder was tried live. He goes down by
falling or by sinking slowly through tiles `$62`-`$65` (`tile_touch_b`).
The same run shows gravity on (`$45FF = 1`), the scroll off
(`$4555 = $FF`) and no fall limit (`$457A = $FF`) everywhere.

The fire button does not jump. `fire_pressed` jumps where the level has
gravity (every screen) and would bring in the second character where it
has not (`switch_check` `$C7D4`), which no screen uses.

The live key tests needed the host-key path. `vice_keyboard_matrix`
held by row and column left `$C5` at `$40` for every key on this build;
`vice_keyboard_key_press` reached it (`work/verify4.py`, `work/verify6.py`).
It accepts no name for SHIFT, so SHIFT is traced, not tested.

## Graphics

Every screen is multicolour text over one character set, with eight
sprites. Nothing scrolls and nothing is drawn as a bitmap.

| Thing | Where | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Play character set | `$3000`-`$37FF` (`$D018 = $1C`) | Glyphs `$00`-`$7F` (`$3000`-`$33FE`) are copied in per screen from the level record's `+6` descriptor by `setup_screen` `$5E19`; the text glyphs `$80`-`$BF` stay; `$3600` up is sprite data, so glyphs `$C0`-`$FF` are never shown. Glyph classes, by code: `$00`-`$29` open, `$2A`-`$4C` solid, `$4D`-`$53` a crumbling ledge in seven stages, `$54`-`$57` pick-ups, `$58`-`$7F` floors, `$80`-`$BF` the text |
| Per-screen sets, play areas, colour maps | `$8000`-`$B1FF`, `$A00` per outward screen | forest `$8000`, cinema `$8A00`, ghetto `$9400`, graveyard `$9E00`, house `$A800`: the 1 KB set, then at `+$450` the play area (screen rows 2-24, 928 bytes, copied to `$0450`), then at `+$800` the colour map, two cells per byte (`unpack_colours` `$5D20`). The way-back records reuse the outward set and colour map and take the play area from the store |
| Card and title font | `$B200`-`$B5FE` | copied to `$3000` by `show_level_card` `$5BC7`; holds the CHILLER logo pieces that `draw_logo` `$5C00` lays out five glyphs deep |
| Boy's sprites | `$3600`, pointers `$D8`-`$E7` | walking left `$D8`, right `$DC`, jumping `$E0`/`$E1`, standing `$E2`/`$E6` |
| Girl's sprites | `$3A00`, pointers `$E8`-`$F7` | the same order; `player_swap` `$576B` patches the frame numbers |
| Enemy sprites | `$2000`-`$29FF` (`$80`-`$A7`), `$0B00`-`$0FFE` (`$2C`-`$3F`) | four frames an animation, named per screen in the level record (`+$1D`, `+$22`); the low blocks are used by records 1, 2 and 5-9 (`work/sprites_used.py`) |
| Thrown enemy, dying frames | `$3E00`, `$F8`-`$FC` | `extra_enemy` on sprite 7; `enemy_dying` steps `$F9`-`$FC` |
| Stored screens for the way back | `$7800`, `$E000`, `$E400`, `$E800`, `$EC00` | `screen_store` `$7FE8`; see Mechanics |

The ten screens, reached live by playing through with crosses poked beside
the boy (`work/playthrough.py`), are in `reference/screen-00-forest.png` to
`reference/screen-09-forest-back.png`.

The border is the player indicator on every screen, not only on the way
back: `tick_border` `$75B0` puts it back each pass to 6 (blue) for the boy
or 10 (light red) for the girl, and `flash_border` `$72BA` toggles its
bit 3 while poison drains the bar.

## Hardware register census

`work/sweep_regs.py` over `$0800`-`$CFFF`: every absolute access to
`$D000`-`$DFFF` (`work/sweep-regs.txt`, 97 registers). It counts byte
patterns, so a hit in data is a false one: the ones at odd addresses
such as `$D053`, `$D112`, `$D74A` and `$DD99` all fall in graphics or
tables and are left out here.

| Registers | What the game does with them | Where |
|---|---|---|
| `$D000`-`$D00F`, `$D010` | Sprite positions. 0 is the character under control, 1 the other one (`swap_sprites` `$58E6`), 2-6 the five enemy slots, 7 the thrown enemy (`extra_enemy`) | many; `$C3E0`-`$C3F2` is seven `DEC`s of sprites 1-7's Y in a row |
| `$D015` | Sprite enable, 45 accesses: sprites switched on and off with the screens | `$0907`, `$2BF2`, `$2DA2`, … |
| `$D016` | Multicolour text on (`ORA #$10`); 40 columns on (`ORA #$08`) and off (`AND #$F7`) | multicolour at `show_card` `$5C62` and `$5D80`; `$2BF5` sets and `$C026` clears bit 3 |
| `$D018` | `$15` (the ROM font, screen `$0400`) before printing through the KERNAL, `$1C` (font at `$3000`) after | `$15` at `$2CD1` and `$55C4`; `$1C` at `$2EFB`, `show_card` `$5C6C` and `$C6B1` |
| `$D01B`, `$D01C`, `$D01D` | Sprite priority, multicolour, X expansion | `$2E97`, `$2D1C`, `$2D22`, … |
| `$D01E` | Sprite-sprite collision: `sprite_touch` `$CE87` takes energy when an enemy touches sprite 0 or 1; `restart_screen` reads it to clear it; `$0987` is in the loader's area | `$0987`, `$C6DA`, `$CE87` |
| `$D01F` | Sprite-background collision, read once | `$2D60` |
| `$D020`, `$D021` | Border and background. The manual says the border shows who is being controlled on the way back; these writes are where to look | `$2CC7`, `$515D`, `$57B7`, `$590E`, `$5A4B`; `game_over_wait` `$7720` reads the border |
| `$D022`-`$D024` | Multicolour background colours, set per screen | `$5BD5`, `$5D8A`, `$758E`, `$7623`, … |
| `$D025`-`$D02E` | Sprite colours | `$2B90`, `$2D10`, `$5554`, … |
| `$D011`, `$D012` | Read only, never written. Two copies of one wait loop spin until the raster is line 16 (`$D012 = $10` and `$D011` bit 7 clear); `$C46B` spins until line `$4B` | `$5BB0`, `$72C7`, `$C46B` |
| `$D400`-`$D40D` | Voices 1 and 2: the music (`music_*`, `mcmd_*`) | `$60BF`-`$61D6` |
| `$D40E`-`$D414` | Voice 3: the sound effects, all outside the music player | `$2BE3`, `$2F05`, `$5485`-`$552C` |
| `$D415`-`$D418` | Filter and volume, set once: `$D415 = $05`, `$D416 = $45` (an 11-bit cutoff of `$22D`), `$D417 = $F1` (resonance 15, voice 1 through the filter), `$D418 = $3F` (low-pass and band-pass, volume 15) | `music_init_filter` `$60A0` |
| `$DC00` | The joystick | `$2D97`, `$58BD`, `$C1C0`, `$C8C5`, `$C8D3`, `$C8E1`, `$C9C4`, `$C9DB` |
| `$D800`- | Colour RAM | many |

Never touched from the game's code: `$D013`, `$D017`, `$D019`, `$D01A`
(no raster interrupt), the CIA timers and interrupt control (`$DC04`-
`$DC0F`, `$DD04`-`$DD0F`), `$DD00` (the VIC bank stays at 0), and SID
voice 3's pulse width and oscillator read-back (`$D410`, `$D411`,
`$D41B`, `$D41C`).

## Mechanics

**The journey.** `level_records` `$7290` lists ten records by level byte
(0, 2 … `$12`): forest, cinema, ghetto, graveyard, haunted house going out
(`$7000`-`$7200`), then the house, graveyard, ghetto, cinema and forest
coming back (`$7300`-`$7500`). A screen ends when its crosses are all
taken: `crosses_left` `$7F00` counts `$5A15` down from the record's
`+$72` (5 going out, 10 coming back, *live*), then `next_screen` `$7680`
shows the next card and builds the next screen. After level byte `$12`
it passes `$FE`, which ends the game in a win. There is no car: the last
screen is the forest.

**The way back reuses the screens as they were left.** Going out,
`next_screen` copies the finished screen (rows 1-24) into a store before
moving on (`screen_store` `$7FE8`: `$7800`, `$E000`, `$E400`, `$E800`,
`$EC00`), and the way-back records read their play areas from there, the
four under the KERNAL through `copy_under_kernal` `$72A4`. So a mushroom
eaten going out is gone coming back. *Live*: played through, the way-back
screens show the outward screens with the poked crosses taken
(`reference/screen-05-house-back.png` onwards); started directly on a
way-back screen by poking `start_game`'s operand `$C661`, the unwritten
store shows as garbage.

**Two characters, two colours of cross.** Each record's `+$5E`-`+$71`
holds ten cross positions, five blue and five red (`place_crosses`
`$5FC0`; `colour_cycle` `$7F80` flashes them by toggling the multicolour
bit every 40th call). `cross_touch` `$7F50` reads the colour: the boy
(`$5A08 = 0`) takes only blue, the girl only red. *Live*: blue crosses
poked beside the boy were taken and counted, red ones were left. Going
out only the boy plays and each screen needs five; coming back both play
and all ten are needed.

**Three crosses cannot be reached.** `work/reach.py` models `try_move`'s
own rules (below) and searches every screen pixel by pixel from the
start position in its record. Nine of the ten screens have every cross
reachable this way. Three blue crosses do not: graveyard-back (record
`$7380`) at screen address `$079A`, ghetto-back (`$7400`) at `$07C5`,
cinema-back (`$7480`) at `$07CC`, all in the play area's bottom two
rows. *Live* (`work/verify_reach4.py`): with a column cleared to open
space and nothing to land on, the boy still falls no further than Y
`$E3`, row 22 by `try_move`'s own `(Y-$2C)>>3` — `move_sprite`'s Y clamp
(`$C930`, `cmp #$E3`) is unconditional, checked before any tile is read,
so his own position can never be computed as row 23 or 24, whatever the
scenery there says. All three are on the way back, where every cross,
blue and red, is needed to finish, so all three would stop a
completionist there. This is a wider fault than the Lemon64 comment's
one cross (`features.md`), but the same shape: level data placed below
where the engine's own sprite can ever stand.

**Switching.** `switch_request` `$58B3` takes fire or `?` (key code
`$37`); `switch_allowed` `$7280` refuses before level byte 10.
`player_swap` `$576B` swaps sprites 0 and 1, so the character under
control is always sprite 0, patches the frame numbers, and sets the
border. *Live*: `/` in the forest changed nothing; on the way back fire
and `/` each gave the girl and the light red border (`$5A08` 0 → 1,
border 6 → 10). The character left standing loses energy when an enemy
touches it (`girl_touch` `$CD9D`).

**Jumping.** `start_jump` `$5418` lifts the boy for up to 24 steps, each
waiting `jump_speeds` `$544A` passes (5 rising to 45): a slowing rise, then
the same table backwards for a quickening fall. The direction held at
take-off is kept; the controls are switched off in the air by writing RTS
over the first byte of `read_controls` and `frame_step` (`jump_lockout`
`$5880`). A fall is counted, but the compare with the limit at `$457A` is
followed only by NOPs, so **no fall hurts** (`land` `$53EF`).

**The ground.** `try_move` `$2A04` probes the cell the boy would enter,
turning his sprite position into a screen cell: row `(Y-$2C)>>3`,
column `(X-$0C)>>3` with the VIC's X MSB folded in, then `probe_offset`
`$5145` picks the cell to look at (his own row for up, two rows down,
the next row over for left or right). Tiles `$2A`-`$4C` are solid.
Tiles `$4D`-`$53` are a crumbling ledge: every 8th step on one advances
it a stage, and `$53` becomes a space (`tile_touch_a` `$5A9A`). Tiles
`$58`-`$61` and `$70`-`$7F` (`tile_touch_b` `$5AC7`, `$5B89`, `$7673`)
are solid only when the probe is straight down, so they can be walked
into from the side but not fallen onto from above; `$62`-`$65` let him
sink the same way, one try in three (`$5A14`); `$66`-`$6F` are solid
from every direction, with no test of which probe it was.

**The boy's own position is capped at row 22.** `move_sprite` `$C900`
clamps sprite 0's Y at `$E3` unconditionally, before any tile is
checked (`$C930`, `cmp #$E3`), and that is row 22 by `try_move`'s own
formula. *Live* (`work/verify_reach4.py`): falling through a column
cleared to open space, with nothing to land on, the boy's Y still stops
at `$E3` after 128 frames. The play area is drawn 23 rows deep (screen
rows 2-24), but his own sprite position can never be computed as row 23
or 24: see "Three crosses cannot be reached", above.

**Energy.** One bar of 33 cells, 8 steps each, from `$042E`
(`find_bar_end` `$5998`), and no lives: `new_life` and `lose_life` exist
but only unused code reaches them, so an empty bar ends the game
(`out_of_energy` `$5A70`, `screen_done` `$5D98`).

| What | Effect | Where |
|---|---|---|
| Walking | a step off per about 765 passes with a direction held | `walk_drain` `$5A20` |
| Jumping | a step off each time `$5A09` runs out in the air | `drain_step` `$59E6` |
| Standing still | nothing | `drain_step` |
| An enemy touching the one under control | two steps of poison | `sprite_touch` `$CE87`, `poison_add` `$5B44` |
| A toadstool, tile `$55` | 24 steps of poison, each with a border flash | `tile_touch_b` `$5AC7`, `poison_tick` `$5B2C`, `flash_border` `$72BA` |
| A mushroom, tile `$54` | 23 steps back, one every 16 calls; on a full bar 10 points each instead | `energy_add_slow` `$5B18`, `energy_tick` `$5B00`, `energy_up` `$59C3` |
| A bonus, tile `$56` | 100 points | `tile_touch_b` |

*Live*: a mushroom poked under the boy grew the bar from 119 to 142
eighths in six seconds, against 119 → 119 in the control run
(`work/verify2.py`); the toadstool changed the bar (`work/verify.py`).
Standing still with no input the bar held at 119 for 16 s, then lost 69
steps at once, with 69 hits each on `energy_down` and `poison_add`: an
enemy reached him and stayed on him (`work/verify7.py`). The drain with
no input seen at Bronze is that, not a drain of its own.

As the bar goes the boy slows (`bar_speed` `$5961`): once its seventh
cell is no longer full, input is read every `$80` passes instead of every
`$20`. The manual's running is not in the code; there is one walking
speed.

**Enemies.** Five slots, each with a path script in the record
(`+$45`-`+$5D`), animation frames, lives (`$45E7`: 200, 200, 21, 1, 200)
and a respawn chance out of 128 (`$45E2`: 16, 16, 16, 13, 13;
`respawn_timer` `$2FB2`). A sixth on sprite 7 is thrown now and then from
a random slot (`extra_enemy` `$CCF5`). When every slot's lives are used
up, `level_up` `$2C19` counts the LEVEL counter on, shows "LEVEL nnn"
over the play area, and `speed_up` `$5681` halves each slot's move and
frame delays, down to a floor read from `$34E8`.

**Enemy paths, decoded.** Each slot's `+$3B`-`+$3F` (low bytes) and
`+$40`-`+$44` (high bytes) point into `path_scripts` `$4A00`-`$4A8F`
(`setup_screen`, into `$575E`/`enemy_script_hi` `$CF24`); `path_step`
`$CC12` steps one enemy a pixel with `move_sprite` every
`enemy_move_timer` passes and, every 8th step, reads the next byte of
its script: 0 up, 1 down, 2 left, 3 right, `$FF` loops back to the
script's start. Nine scripts serve the ten screens' fifty slots (some
repeat between screens): three walk down then back up
(`$4A00`, `$4A26`, `$4A46`), four hold one direction for ever
(`$4A1E` right, `$4A20` up, `$4A22` left, `$4A24` down), and three are
long runs down with a single stray `$50` partway through
(`$4A6B`, `$4A70`, `$4A73`) that `move_sprite` (`$C900`) does not
recognise as a direction and so does nothing on that one step — not a
fifth direction, just a byte that fails every `cmp` in the dispatch and
falls through to `rts`. When `$453D` is set for a slot (no screen uses
it), `path_step` picks a random one of the script's first 64 bytes
instead of stepping through it in order. At an edge, a slot leaves the
screen unless its `$4538` byte (per slot, part of the level settings)
allows it to stay (`enemy_gone`).

**Score.** Six digits on screen (`$0406`-`$040B`), stepped a point at a
time (`score_inc` `$CE11`, `add_score` `$CE42`). Points come only from
bonus tiles and from mushrooms eaten on a full bar. The high score is
compared digit by digit when a game ends (`$7700`).

## Text

The game has its own character set but keeps the system's glyph order, so
nothing needs a private alphabet table. Read from `work/play-idle.vsf`
(`work/text_vic.py`, `work/sweep_strings.py`):

- **The font during play and on the cards.** `$D018 = $1D` in play and
  `$1C` on the cards (`show_card` `$5C6A`). Either way it points at
  `$3000` in VIC bank 0 (`$DD00 = $C7`), with the screen at `$0400`.
  Glyphs `$80`-`$BF` are the letters, digits and punctuation in
  screen-code order: A at `$81`, 0 at `$B0`, space at `$A0`. So the game's
  own on-screen strings are **screen codes plus `$80`**. `$00`-`$7F` hold
  the scenery tiles. Rendered in `work/charset-play.png`.
- **The card text is plain PETSCII**, printed through the KERNAL's CHROUT
  by `print_card` `$5CD8`. Colour codes (red for a title, blue for the
  verse, white and yellow on the title card) and cursor codes lay it out,
  and `$01` ends it. The first two bytes of a card are the cursor row and
  column, set through PLOT (`$FFF0`).

| Text | Where | Encoding | Printed by |
|---|---|---|---|
| Ten level cards, forest to haunted house and back | `$4100`-`$44E8` | PETSCII, row/column first, `$01` end | `print_card` via `show_card` `$5C4F`, from `$5BE4`; each level's record at `$7000 + $80·n` holds its card's address at `+$74` |
| "THE FOREST", the first level's heading | `$5D0D` | PETSCII card | `show_forest_card` `$5E00` |
| "MASTERTRONIC'S" | `$5D00` | screen codes + `$80` | `show_card` `$5C71`, to `$04D6` |
| The title card: welcome, the goal and the controls | `$7C00` | PETSCII card | `$7760`, after a game ends (`game_over_wait` `$7720`) |
| "PROGRAMMED BY DAVID AND RICHARD DARLING." | `$77C0` | screen codes + `$80` | `show_programmed_by` `$72ED`, to screen row 0 |
| HUD, "SCORE … MAGIC CROSSES … HI" and "ENERGY" | screen `$0400`; copies at `$8400`, and with SILVER CROSSES at `$8E00`, `$9800`, `$A200`, `$AC00` | screen codes + `$80` | `hud_template` `$8400`, copied by `start_game` through `hud_descriptor` `$56C0`; the SILVER CROSSES copies are never copied (see Unused) |
| "LEVEL 001", "GAME OVER" | `$CFA1`, `$CFAA`; a copy at `$0AA1` nothing reads | screen codes + `$80` | `level_banner` `$2C44`, `show_game_over` `$CFC0` |
| "PRESS CTRL FOR MENU" | `$574A` | screen codes + `$80` | `show_press_ctrl` `$5736`, reached after GAME OVER, but it only loads and never stores, so the text never appears (see Bugs) |
| "ANTISOFT", repeated | `$0806`, `$0836`-`$08CF` | PETSCII | the loader (`orientation.md`) |

The ten cards, in the order of the records at `$7000`-`$7574`:

| n | Record | Card | Heading | Verse |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 0 | `$7000` | `$4100` | THE FOREST | MOVE THE BOY AROUND THE FOREST / COLLECTING THE BLUE MAGIC CROSSES. |
| 1 | `$7080` | `$4178` | THE CINEMA | THERE'S A MESSAGE SCRAWLED IN BLOOD... |
| 2 | `$7100` | `$41B8` | THE GHETTO | SAVE YOUR ENERGY, YOU'LL NEED IT. |
| 3 | `$7180` | `$4208` | THE GRAVEYARD | THE MIDNIGHT HOUR IS CLOSE AT HAND, / YOUR DEATH AWAITS IN THIS EVIL LAND. |
| 4 | `$7200` | `$4288` | THE HAUNTED HOUSE | YOUR GIRLFRIEND YOU ARE SEARCHING FOR, / WHEN YOU HAVE THE CROSSES SHE'LL APPEAR / BY THE DOOR. |
| 5 | `$7300` | `$4318` | THE HAUNTED HOUSE | BOTH BOY AND GIRL MUST TURN AROUND, / BECAUSE YOUR QUEST IS HOMEWARD BOUND. |
| 6 | `$7380` | `$4388` | THE GRAVEYARD | BY NOW YOUR ENERGY MUST BE LOW, / SO FIND A MUSHROOM BEFORE YOU SLOW. |
| 7 | `$7400` | `$43F0` | THE GHETTO | THE GHETTO IS A LONELY PLACE, / SO GET YOUR CROSSES WITH GREAT HASTE. |
| 8 | `$7480` | `$4458` | THE CINEMA | THE FINAL MINUTES ARE WITH YOU, / USE THEM WELL. |
| 9 | `$7500` | `$44B0` | THE FOREST | THE END IS NIGH, YOU'RE GOING TO DIE. |

The records are `$80` bytes apart except between 4 and 5, which are
`$100` apart: `$7280`-`$72FF` is not a record, and `$72E0`-`$72FF` in it
is code (`switch_allowed`, `level_records`, `show_programmed_by`). The
fields of a record are under Data tables.

The font has no apostrophe. The cards fake one with cursor codes: up, a
comma, down (`THERE{up},{down}S`), which prints the comma a row higher.
After the cinema card's `$01` end marker come the bytes "N." and another
`$01` (`$41B5`-`$41B7`); no code was found that points at them.

## Sound

The music is a small interpreter on voices 1 and 2, run from the IRQ.
`music_start` `$60CA` silences the SID, points zp `$B7/$B8` (the play
position) and `$B9/$BA` (the loop point) at `$61F8`, sets the filter
(`music_init_filter`) and puts `music_irq` `$60F5` in `$0314`.
`music_stop` `$61D2` gives `$0314` back to the KERNAL's `$EA31`.

Each tick, `music_irq` counts zp `$02` down. At zero, `music_next_command`
`$6100` reads the next byte of the tune and stores it into the low byte
of the `JMP` at `$610B` (`music_dispatch`), so **each command byte is the
low byte of its handler's address in page `$61`**. Operands follow the
command and are read by `music_fetch` `$61E9`. The handlers, read in the
code:

| Byte | Handler | Operands | What it does |
|---|---|---|---|
| `$0E` | `mcmd_note_v1` | freq hi, lo | voice 1 frequency, gate off then on with the stored waveform |
| `$26` | `mcmd_note_v2` | freq hi, lo | the same on voice 2 |
| `$3E` | `mcmd_note_both` | 2 × (hi, lo) | both voices, then falls into `$56` |
| `$56` | `mcmd_retrigger_both` | none | gate both voices off and on again |
| `$6B` | `mcmd_set_tempo` | 1 | ticks per step into `$02AA`, then ends the step |
| `$74` | `mcmd_rest` | none | reloads the counter from `$02AA`: the step ends with nothing new played |
| `$7C` | `mcmd_count` | none | `INC $02FF`, then ends the step |
| `$82` | `mcmd_set_waveforms` | 2 | control bytes for voices 1 and 2 into `$02AC`/`$02AD` |
| `$91` | `mcmd_set_envelopes` | 4 | attack/decay for voices 1 and 2, then sustain/release for 1 and 2 |
| `$AC` | `mcmd_set_pulse` | 4 | pulse width lo/hi for voice 1, then voice 2 |
| `$C7` | `mcmd_loop` | none | play position back to the loop point |
| `$00` | `$6100` itself | none | fetch the next byte at once: a no-op |

The tune runs from `$61F9` to the loop command at `$6A15`: 341 notes and
592 rests over 998 commands, at tempo 6, starting with pulse and
sawtooth (`$41`, `$21`) (`work/sweep_tune.py`, `work/sweep-tune.txt`).

**The tune's pitches are computed for the NTSC clock.** Of its 478
frequency values, 464 come within 2 cents of equal temperament taken at
the NTSC clock (1,022,727 Hz); taken at PAL (985,248 Hz) none do, and the
same 464 sit 33 to 36 cents off, which is 65 cents flat of the note above
(`work/sweep-tune-ntsc.txt`, `work/sweep-tune.txt`). That is the 0.65 of
a semitone the platform reference gives for an NTSC table played on PAL,
the machine this image was run on. Named at the NTSC clock, voice 1
opens C2, D2, F2, G2, D2, F3. The other 14 values are open.

`$02FF` counts `mcmd_count` commands (cleared by `music_start`). Two
places poll it: `$5DAD` waits for it to leave zero and then calls
`music_stop`, and `$7614` branches on it. So the tune can signal the
game: `card_wait` `$7610` holds a card until the card tune's count
command, and `$5DA9` holds GAME OVER until the jingle's (`tune_jingle`
`$6B10`). Voice 3 carries the two sound effects: the jump, a triangle
wave from `$0800` (`jump_sound` `$5483`), and the fall, a whistle from
`$8080` down by `$80` a step (`fall_sound` `$54AC`). A third player,
`unused_sound_player` `$CA80`, has every SID store aimed at `$FFFF`
(see Unused).

## Unused code and data

Unreached means no call, jump, pointer or absolute access names it, and no
run of the kit's simulator (`work/sim_all.sh`, all ten screens from their
start) executed or read it; each is described in `symbols.json`.

- **A shooting game underneath.** `unused_shot_hit` `$CDC7` would score
  a shot's hit on an enemy, `unused_kill_enemy` `$2F7B` switches the enemy
  off and pays out through `add_score_for` `$CE6B`, whose points table is at
  `$4560`. Chiller has no shot, and nothing reaches these.
- **Lives.** `new_life` `$CAED` and `lose_life` `$CEDA`, and the start count
  `$45ED`, are reached only from other unused code. The game has one bar
  and no lives.
- **A silenced sound player.** `unused_sound_player` `$CA80` and
  `unused_note_step` `$C380` play note lists through the 56-note table at
  `$C300`/`$C340`, but every SID store in them has the operand `$FFFF`, in
  the PRG as loaded. The sound was cut before release; the code stayed.
- **A scroller.** `scroll_timer` `$C011`, `scroll_left` `$C412` and
  `scroll_rows` `$C47F` scroll the whole play area a cell, wrapping. Every
  level sets the period to `$FF`, which turns it off.
- **A second character on a flat screen.** `switch_check` `$C7D4` brings
  sprite 1 in with fire on a screen without gravity; every screen has
  gravity. `sprite1_hit_scenery` `$C4FB` waits on `$45FE`, which is 0.
- **Screen-editor tools.** `unused_editor_tools` `$5198` (a box drawer, a
  character plotter) and `unused_screen_tools` `$C038` (fills, a glyph
  mirror) call only each other.
- **An older forest card.** `card_forest_title` `$5D0D`, printed by
  `show_forest_card` `$5E00`, which nothing calls.
- **SILVER CROSSES.** The cinema, ghetto and house blocks each carry HUD
  rows (`hud_cinema` `$8E00`, `hud_ghetto` `$9800`, `hud_house` `$AC00`)
  that say SILVER CROSSES where the real HUD says MAGIC CROSSES. Their
  play areas are copied from `+$50`, so these rows are never shown: a
  trace of an earlier name for the crosses.
- **Loaded, unread.** `$1000`-`$1FFF` (pages of near-identical rows),
  `$4040`-`$40FF` (after the note list at `$4000` that `unused_note_step`
  would read), `$4A90`-`$50FD`, `$6BCD`-`$6FFD`; what they held is not
  established. Looked into further for Gold:
  - `$1000`-`$1FFF`: not sprite data. Read as 64-byte multicolour sprites
    (`work/render_1000.py`, printed and checked by eye), every block is
    visual noise, no recognisable shape; the "near-identical rows"
    description holds (64-byte periods differ by only a few bytes) but
    what repeats at that period is not established.
  - `$4A90`-`$4AFF`: shaped exactly like `path_scripts` (`$4A00`-`$4A8F`,
    immediately before it) — bytes `$00`-`$03` ended by `$FF`, several
    scripts' worth back to back — but no level record's `+$3B`-`+$44`
    names any address in it. Very likely more enemy paths that no
    screen's enemy table points at, cut along with a design that did not
    ship. `$4B00` on no longer fits that pattern.
  - `$4B00`-`$50FD`, `$6BCD`-`$6FFD`: no pattern as clear as the above was
    found; still open.

The RAM under the I/O chips (`$D000`-`$DFFF`) and under the KERNAL above
the stores (`$F000`-`$FFFF`) is loaded and never read; `game.json`
excludes both with the reason.

## Bugs

- **PRESS CTRL FOR MENU never appears.** `show_press_ctrl` `$5736` runs
  after GAME OVER and loads the text and colour bytes for row 23, but
  every access is an `LDA`: nothing is stored.
- **The jump sound falls on the way down too.** `jump_pitch_fall` `$5518`
  adds 5 to the low byte and should carry into the high byte; its `BCS`
  at `$5524` branches to the next instruction, so the high byte is
  decremented every step and the pitch drops about 256 a step instead of
  rising.
- **The title flicker misses a register.** `title_flicker` `$7580`
  should flicker `$D022` and `$D023`; its second store goes to `$7523`, a
  byte in level record 9's tail, so only `$D022` flickers.
- **Dead reads in GAME OVER.** `show_game_over` `$CFC0` reads `$CFA1`,
  `$0617` and `$D81A` and throws them away, left from a copy of
  `level_banner`.

## Live tests

All from `work/play-idle.vsf` (the forest, outward, standing) or the
snapshots saved from it, with the stick on port 2; each script names its
control.

| Blue crosses poked beside the boy | `verify.py`, `verify3.py` | taken: needed 5 → 0, the card for the next screen clears the HUD, which comes back reading `05` |
| Red crosses beside the boy | `verify.py` | left, counter unchanged |
| Five blue crosses end the screen | `verify3.py` | the cinema follows (record `$7080`) |
| A mushroom under him | `verify2.py` | bar 119 → 142 eighths in 6 s; control 119 → 119 |
| A toadstool under him | `verify.py` | the bar changes |
| Jump with stick up | `verify2.py` | in-air flag 1, Y 224 → 205 → 220 |
| Jump with SHIFT (host-key path has no name for it) | `verify_shift.py` | `$028D` held at 1, re-poked every frame against `SCNKEY`'s own overwrite; in-air flag 1, Y 224 → 205 within 30 frames |
| Z, C, SPACE, `/` by the host-key path | `verify6.py` | Z, C walk; SPACE nothing; `/` nothing going out |
| `/` and fire on the way back | `verify3.py`, `verify6.py` | the girl, border 6 → 10 |
| All ten screens by play | `playthrough.py` | records `$7000` … `$7500` in order, needed 5 then 10, `reference/screen-*.png` |
| Starting on a way-back screen | `verify3.py`, `shots10.py` | the unwritten store shows as garbage |
| Level settings on every screen | `settings10.py` | directions 0 0 1 1, gravity 1, scroll `$FF`, fall limit `$FF` |
| What drains the bar standing still | `verify7.py` | an enemy: 69 hits each on `energy_down` and `poison_add`; control `music_irq` 1,799 in 30 s |
| The keyboard scan runs | `verify5.py` | SCNKEY `$EA87` 61 in 1 s; the matrix tool left `$C5` at `$40`, the host-key path reached it |
